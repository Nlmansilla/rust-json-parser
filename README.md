# JSON Parsers
A resolution of the challenge written by John Crickett: https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-json-parser

# Usage
* Execute `cargo run {file_path}` for execution without building.
* As an option, build the app and then use it calling it by the chosen name. I.E: `cargo build --release` and then, in the release folder execute `json-parser {file_path}`

#TODO: ### **The parser supports the formats provided by the challenge. Anyway, further formats support is needed**
- [ ] Split Parser from Lexer.
